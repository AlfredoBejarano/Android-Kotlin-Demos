# Summary
Recently I migrated to Kotlin for Android Development. I'll keep in this repository some small demos of tasks that I've been asked for _(For my job or personal projects)_.

If someone finds them useful, feel free to take a look at them or to contribute to them.

# Demos
This repository contains the following demos:

 - **[Text-To-Speech Demo](./TextToSpeechDemo)** Basic app in which you input some text and the app reads it.
 - **[Circular Progress Bar Demo](./CircularProgressBarDemo)** Fancy ProgressBar using custom drawables to represent its progress.
 - **[Kotlin Local Server Demo](./KotlinLocalServerDemo)** Simple app that loads a JSON in a WebView using a local server created by the app Itself using the [**Ktor framework**](https://ktor.io/).
 - 
I hope you find these useful.
